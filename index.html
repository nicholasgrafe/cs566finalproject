        <p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Traffic Congestion Trends by Bidirectional Flow Analysis</p>
        <p><strong>Team Members:</strong> Ayush Sharma, Nico Grafe, Zhaoyang Liu</p>

        <h2>Current Progress:</h2>
        <p>
            The three of us worked on a few different methods to extract data from traffic camera videos. 
            We each used YOLO but collected different data on the same video. Our different approaches each 
            have their own strengths and drawbacks. We plan to combine the models next and incorporate the 
            best parts of each. Then we can start working on visualizing the data and perform trend analysis on it.
        </p>

        <h2>Attempted Methods:</h2>

        <h3>Method 1:</h3>
        <p>
            Inspired by what we have learned on edge detection and boundary detection in CS566, we started 
            off by using built-in functions in cv2 (OpenCV Python module) such as <code>findContours</code> 
            to build our vehicle detection system. We first use a function called <code>VideoCapture</code> 
            to break the video into frames so that later we can process them one by one and then reconstruct 
            the original video with the annotations.
        </p>

        <p>
            We segment the video into its moving foreground objects and static background to only leave 
            the objects that we are interested in (i.e., vehicles). After that, we perform a series of 
            operations to refine our mask to remove noise from the frames and isolate individual objects 
            from each other through erosion and dilation. After that, we perform <code>findContours</code> 
            to find the contour of each detected object.
        </p>

        <p>
            To filter out errors while finding contours, we assume each valid contour should have a 
            relatively large area (current threshold: 550). For each valid contour, we draw a rectangle 
            around each detected vehicle.
        </p>

        <p>
            The screenshots below show the results. As we observed, even after refining our mask and 
            applying thresholds, some extra boundary boxes appear or two close vehicles are merged. 
            More aggressive filtering removes these issues but also suppresses smaller vehicles, causing 
            data inaccuracies. This is a drawback of traditional CV methods based on static algorithms, 
            especially in scenes involving 3D objects.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because of these limitations, we moved toward modern approaches with YOLO, which has gained 
            traction for object detection due to its anchor-based deep learning architecture and strong 
            performance. Our next steps involve combining YOLO’s strengths with our filtering approach to 
            further refine detection accuracy.
