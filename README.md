# CS 566 Final Project – Traffic Congestion Trends by Bidirectional Flow Analysis

This project analyzes traffic patterns using computer vision techniques. We use YOLO-based vehicle detection, multi-object tracking, and perspective transformation to measure direction, speed, flow rate, and congestion trends on bidirectional roadways. The website summarizes our approach, results, and insights from applying both classical and deep learning methods to real traffic footage.
